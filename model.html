			<h1>Application of the methodology to Belgium’s energy system</h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				The main elements of the methodology for Belgium’s energy system are:
			</p>
			<ul style="text-align:justify">
			  <li>
				  Three clusters are defined: INLAND (Belgium); ZEEBRUGGE (coastal area); OFFSHORE (Belgian exclusive economic zone). Energy transport capacity is unlimited inside the clusters, but capacity is limited or has to be built between the clusters;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Energy demand for electricity, methane and hydrogen for 2050 are set as in the “Distributed Energy” scenario of the TYNDP 2022 published by ENTSOG/ENTSO-E [add note]. Energy demand is located in the INLAND cluster. Demand profiles are based on historical data;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Demand-side management is implemented for electricity – load shifting, load shedding;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Domestic energy production capacities can be built up to the maximum potential defined in the TYNDP 2022. Solar PV and onshore wind are in the INLAND cluster, while offshore wind is in the OFFSHORE cluster;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Missing energy – green electricity, methane and hydrogen – can be imported in the COASTAL or INLAND clusters from neighbouring countries; green electricity imports are supposed to follow the same production profile as in Belgium; liquid natural gas can be imported by ship in the COASTAL cluster (Zeebrugge harbour);
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Grids for electricity and methane are uncongested inside the clusters and actual capacities between clusters can be increased through investments;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Conversion technologies – power-to-hydrogen (electrolysis); methane-to-power (CCGTs) – can be built in the OFFSHORE or INLAND clusters;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Storage technologies – batteries for electricity; tanks for hydrogen; linepack and underground storage for methane – can be developed in the 3 clusters, depending on physical capabilities;
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Carbon removal technologies – post-combustion carbon capture (PCCC), Direct Air Capture (DAC) – can be developed in order to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions.
			  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The overall architecture of the clusters is shown hereunder. The three clusters are displayed, along with the three energy carriers – electricity, methane and hydrogen. The neighbouring countries are modelized as import nodes. The INLAND cluster can emit, capture, and export CO2, while the COASTAL cluster can only capture it.

			<h2>Detailed topology</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				A schema of the OFFSHORE cluster is shown hereafter. It considers 2 energy carriers – electricity and hydrogen –, and one additional commodity – water. There are 4 conversion nodes – wind offshore, fuel cell, electrolyser, desalination –, and 3 flexibility nodes – electricity, water and hydrogen storage.

				<br><br>
				The COASTAL cluster is shown hereafter. It considers 3 energy carriers – electricity, hydrogen and methane –, and one additional commodity – carbon dioxide. It includes 10 nodes: 4 conversion nodes – fuel cells, electrolyser, methanation, DAC –, 2 flexibility nodes – electricity and hydrogen storage –, and 4 import nodes – methane from Norway, UK and France, synthetic methane import.
				<br><br>
				[Topology of COASTAL cluster = fig.5 of Jocelyn paper – fixed image]
				<br><br>
				The INLAND cluster is shown hereafter. It considers 3 energy carriers – electricity, hydrogen and methane –, and one additional commodity – carbon dioxide. It includes 30 nodes: 12 conversion nodes – solar PV, wind onshore, electrolyser, fuel cell, DAC, methanation, biomethane production, CCGT, OCGT, Steam Methane Reforming, 3 PCCCs, 12 flexibility nodes – electricity storage, [PH], methane storage, hydrogen and CO2 storage, linepack (methane), load shifting and 5 kinds of load shedding –, 2 import nodes – methane from Germany and hydrogen from the Netherlands – and 1 export node for CO2.

			<h2>Main parameters</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				All technologies, except for natural gas storage, pumped-hydro power plants, and existing electrical lines and natural gas pipelines in Belgium would be completely replaced by 2050. The installed capacities of technologies in neighboring countries are considered constant throughout the optimization horizon. The electrical lines and natural gas pipelines connecting Belgium to its neighbours are assumed to be already established at their maximum capacities, based on future projects proposed by Elia and Fluxys. A gas pipeline connecting Belgium to the Netherlands is repurposed for hydrogen transportation.
				The parameters of all technologies related to the production, transport, conversion and storage of electricity, methane and hydrogen – maximum capacity, capex, fixed opex, variable opex, conversion factors, flexibility, efficiency – are listed and referred to in [ref. to Jocelyn paper].
				Potential for renewable production in Belgium in 2050 are set .according to Elia’s Roadmap to 2050 study [add note] and Valbiom study [add note]:
