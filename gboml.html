			<h2>INTEGRATION project</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				Fluxys Belgium and ULiège have worked on the INTEGRATION project over the period 2020-2024, supported by the Energy Transition Fund of the Belgian federal government. This demonstration website is part of the deliverables of the project.
				INTEGRATION stands for “INTeraction Electricité, Gaz et autres Réseaux énergétiques : modélisAtion, opTi-misation, Investissements et régulatiON”.
				This project aims at developing a methodology to model and optimize energy systems by 2050, taking all energy networks and demand sectors into account. The methodology focuses primarily on the interaction between gas and electricity because of the increasingly important role of gas – methane, hydrogen – to ensure security of supply in Belgium. Conversion technologies like power-to-gas and gas-to-power enable energy system integration – a dynamic interaction between electricity and gas systems that ensures system adequacy and optimizes competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.
				The methodology is used to calculate an optimal energy system as the system with the minimal total cost – annualized investments, operations – under constraints, e.g. reduced or net-zero CO2 emissions. To achieve that goal, green or low-carbon energy is produced in Belgium or imported: green electricity from wind, sun and hydro; green methane from biomethane or synthetic methane; green hydrogen from electrolysis of green electricity. In order to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions, low-carbon gas and electricity is also produced with carbon capture and storage.
				The complete methodology of the optimisation problem is described in [ref. to Jocelyn paper].

			<h2>GBOML</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				In the framework of the INTEGRATION project, GBOML – Graph-Based Optimization Modeling Language – has been developed to describe the topology and parameters of energy system optimisation problems. [add ref.] A compiler processes GBOML files, feeds a linear optimizer and gets results that can be analysed. The results include the optimal capacity to build for each technology, the optimal use of each technology hour by hour, the cost of the energy system and each technology, the “Energy Not Served” and the “Curtailment” of variable renewable electricity.
				The GBOML grammar and the compiler are open-source. They are available at [ref. to Orbi].
				This demonstrator uses the GBOML language to process the Belgian energy system in 2050 and to get results that are presented and illustrated with graphs.

			<h2>System description</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				The methodology is applied for Belgium’s energy system in 2050. The topology and parameters are described in [“System description” section]. It aims at a net-zero energy system composed of electricity, methane and hydrogen (including derivates like ammonia or methanol).
			</p>
			<h2>Base case and Sensitivities</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				The main results of Belgium’s energy system in 2050 are presented in the “Base Case” section with PowerBI screens that help to analyse detailed results of the optimal energy system.
				Some parameters of the base case have been modified to show how they influence results. These sensitivities are presented in the respective sections with PowerBI screens highlighting the changes:
				<ul style="text-align:justify">
				  <li>Sensitivity 1 “High renewable potential”: the potential of solar PV, onshore and offshore wind is increased in order to test the limits of integration of variable RES into the energy system;</li>
				  <li>Sensitivity 2: “Farther offshore wind”: the distance of offshore wind is increased to highlight when it is more interesting to produce hydrogen offshore rather than onshore</li>
				  <li>Sensitivity 3: “CO2 budget”: […]</li>
				  <li>Sensitivity 4: “H2 import cost”: […]</li>
				  <li>Sensitivity 5: “CO2 export capacity”: […]</li>
				</ul>
