### Key conclusions 
In order to reach carbon neutrality at the lowest cost, the model identifies the optimum between the cost of technologies, their efficiencies and their CO2 emissions.
For renewable electricity production, wind turbines are more efficient than solar PV to supply electricity due to the higher capacity factor, lower intermittency profile and lower curtailment. This causes win turbines to be installed to the maximal potential while only ~50% of the potential for solar PVs is installed.
To complement renewable electricity production, gas-fired power plants are installed to fulfil the remaining electricity demand and avoid “energy not served”. As these plants emit large amounts of CO2, carbon capture (PCCC) and Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities are installed.
Although natural gas imports are cheaper than biomethane production, the model chooses to produce biomethane at the maximal potential to reduce CO2 emissions.
Belgium still imports 108 TWh [of what?], 33% less than in 2022. Renewable electricity is also used by electrolysers to produce green hydrogen when there is too much renewable electricity and not enough electricity demand, thereby maximising the capacity and use of renewable energy.
To optimise the cost of interconnections (electricity vs hydrogen), green hydrogen from offshore wind is produced at COASTAL and OFFSHORE clusters. However this production is not sufficient and most of the hydrogen demand is imported.
Finally, renewable electricity is stored in batteries to improve adequacy of demand and supply for short durations. Conversion to hydrogen and hydrogen storage are used as well but for longer durations. Seasonal storage is provided by existing methane storage, which is very cheap.
